How to play:
Your objective in this game is to identify and pin down the position of as many mines as possible.

Reveal tiles with a left mouse click, and pin tiles you suspect are mines with a right mouse click.

On tiles adjacent to mines, there will be an indicator showing how many mines are adjacent to the tile from 1 to 8.

On every click, mines will shift along the board randomly unless flagged.

This game is played in levels - once all empty tiles are revealed, the next level will load, adding an extra row and column to the board.

You are also limited by a timer of 5 minutes, however you gain 20 seconds every time a level is cleared.

Your current score is shown in the top left, with your high score in the bottom left, and the time remaining on the top right.

[WARNING: should you clear your browser cache/cookies, you will lose your high score.]
